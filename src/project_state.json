  "summary": "Onebit is being rebuilt from scratch as a calm, minimal focus web app that works stably without live LLMs by default. The core flow is fixed (Landing → Mental Dump → Context Snapshot (blocker+time) → deterministic Focus Compression → Action Mode (single task + client timer) → Manual Check-in → deterministic Recovery (micro-steps) → Session End → light Session History). The product is local-first with optional opt-in backend sync (Motoko backend optional). LLM integration is strictly backend-only, disabled by default, limited to Focus Compression + Recovery (max 3 calls/session), and must always fallback to deterministic rules on error/timeout. Required additions include demo mode with 3 canned sessions, an admin private panel for backend-only OPENAI_API_KEY plus demo video link + pitch text, accessibility + Grok/Calm-inspired theme, and exporting sessions as .txt, with build notes documenting LLM hooks and safe enablement.",

    "Frontend is a React SPA with an explicit multi-step flow state machine in App.tsx (landing → mental dump → context → action → check-in → recovery → end).",
    "Frontend uses @tanstack/react-query for all backend reads/mutations, including cache invalidation and refetching when the authenticated actor changes.",
    "Internet Identity integration is encapsulated in a React context provider (AuthClient), with identity persistence across reloads and a custom login status state machine.",
    "Backend is a Motoko canister actor (ICP) using a migration hook pattern `(with migration = Migration.run)` and in-memory Maps for sessions and user profiles.",
    "Authorization is implemented via a mixin (`MixinAuthorization`) and an `access-control` module mapping Principals to roles (admin/user/guest). Admin bootstrap uses an environment variable token plus a user-provided secret.",
    "Sensitive bootstrap secret (admin token) is read from URL hash and persisted in sessionStorage, then removed from the URL via history.replaceState to reduce leakage.",
    "OpenAI integration is done via ICP HTTP outcalls (management canister `IC.http_request`) with a transform function that strips response headers.",
    "AI responses are post-processed on the frontend (parseAIResponse) to handle OpenAI JSON format, strip a required `.semanticDot` suffix, normalize punctuation, and classify error modes (admin key error vs service error).",
    "UI styling uses TailwindCSS with a custom OKLCH “calm” design token palette and next-themes ThemeProvider (forced light by default), plus shadcn/ui-style components and sonner toasts.",
    "Resilience patterns include explicit 35s timeouts for AI calls, limited retries (react-query mutation retry=1), and fallback task suggestions when AI is unavailable."

  "known_issues": [
    "Two CSS entrypoints are present in the repo dump (`frontend/src/index.css` and `frontend/index.css`); only `src/index.css` is imported, but duplication may cause confusion/drift.",
    "Outcall cycle budget is a fixed constant; failures due to insufficient cycles or oversized responses are not explicitly handled (max_response_bytes is null).",
    "OpenAI requests are intermittently failing due to missing required request fields (e.g., `model`) and/or missing `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header; key storage/lookup may be inconsistent between deployments, leading to 'AI key missing/invalid' and 'API key not found' errors.",
    "AI integration reliability is currently unstable (repeated failures across focus-task generation), indicating the backend may not be consistently using the admin-stored key and/or not persisting it correctly across rebuilds/deploys."
